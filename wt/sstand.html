        Easy and Engaging read from the first chapter till the end. The Prologue about mind and soul is very relevant in reality. The author has portrayed each and every character with the utmost significance of their own and every one of them has done justice
        to their respective roles throughout the story. The story revolves around Sibling's unconditional love through thick and thin. I loved the scene where the sisters introduce their partners to Kartik. Unexpected happenings surprises you and unfolding
        of the mystery make you edgy. I finished the book in one sitting as I was curious to know what happens next. The Interrogations arises a lot of questions in the mind of the readers. There are many versions of the story. Would Kartik be able to
        separate lies from the truth? Brace your seatbelts to experience the roller-coaster journey of mystery, secrets, suspense, investigations, beliefs, trust, and shocking revelations.

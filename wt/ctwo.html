        Adapted as a hit film, this book is the fourth in Bhagat’s list of novels and also the fourth one to be adapted as a movie. This fun-filled love story that gets complicated when the question of marriage comes up, is a loose adaptation of Chetan Bhagat’s
        own marriage. This is a story of a love affair between two IIM students hailing from two different states, Punjab and Tamil Nadu. Miles apart in distance and custom, Krish and Ananya’s love blossoms within the confines of their college walls.
        But with the end of college and beginning of a career, the question of marriage does not stand far away. They embark on a journey of convincing their parents for the marriage. But the persuasion takes a lot more than just a few words. The journey
        that the couple takes from being romantically involved to getting married is full of twists and turns. This is more because, in India, it is easy to fall in love but tricky to convert that love into a love marriage. The book details the quintessential
        Indian parents, the way marriages generally work in India and the two varied cultures beautifully; it also goes on to show that far beyond religion and creed, love keeps fighting for its place.</P>

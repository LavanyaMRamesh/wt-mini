        finished this Fiction Novel today morning which is written by 'Mr. Sudeep Nagarkar' & the Title of the book is 'Few Things Left Unsaid'. The book has two main characters - Aditya & Riya. This Novel majorly highlights the college scene about Aditya's Entrance
        exam, his first day, ragging, excitement, bunking the classes, a loads of assignments & ofcourse! his first true love. Most of us hates the word Engineering..isn't it?? Like us (Who hates it) Aditya, who is a hot blooded guy, too hated engineering,
        but his destiney landed him being one of the student of engineering department. You will learn alot from this fictious novel through Aditya & Riya's sweet & bitter relationship's story..that college friends are forever, never take your partner
        for granted if ever, you are in a serious relationship, & that time and destiney surely tests you hard!</P>

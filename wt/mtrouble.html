        THE TROUBLE WITH WOMEN is a new short story collection by award-winning novelist Meghna Pant. The evocative and poignant stories address sensitive dilemmas faced by Indian women, with themes such as molestation, abortion, sexual harassment, domestic violence
        and senicide. The stories include a newlywed woman, caught in a landslide during her honeymoon in Sikkim, who is torn between telling her husband that she’s not a virgin or saving her arranged marriage. A wife attends Vipassana to heal from marital
        rape only to be seduced by an attractive white woman. A man succumbs to his violent tendencies when he meets his ex-wife’s boyfriend. An ambitious woman contemplates sleeping with her sleazy boss as he misbehaves with other women at a society
        party. A ten-year-old Tamil boy befriends a mysterious girl at the cremation of his beloved grandmother
